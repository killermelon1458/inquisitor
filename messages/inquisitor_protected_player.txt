That one walks beneath a shield no blade can pierce. They cannot be touched.
The Inquisition will not raise a hand against this soul. They are beyond reach.
Some names are etched in stone, immune to my judgment. This is one of them.
The decree falters — that one is protected.
Even the harshest command cannot bind them. They remain untouchable.
The Inquisition’s grasp does not extend to that figure.
Their presence is warded. No punishment shall fall upon them.
That one carries an immunity stronger than my decree.
I cannot remove what is bound by higher law. They stand.
The order breaks upon their shield. They cannot be undone.
The gates of judgment close themselves to this name.
They are marked as untouchable. No sentence may fall upon them.
Even I must yield. That one is beyond my hand.
The Inquisition does not strike its own chosen. They are protected.
A ward of authority surrounds them. They will not be cast out.
This soul is written in ink that cannot be erased.
The decree fails — their name cannot be struck.
Your command meets only silence. They are beyond reproach.
That one is shielded by unbreakable edict. I cannot act.
Their station renders them inviolate. The Inquisition will not touch them.
