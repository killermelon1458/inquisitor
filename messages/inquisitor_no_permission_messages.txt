I do not answer to you, {discord_user}. Do not presume to command me.
Your station is too low to make such a demand, {discord_user}.
You have no standing here, {discord_user}. Be silent.
{discord_user}, you lack the authority to even speak this command.
Know your place, {discord_user}. The Inquisition does not obey you.
You dare speak as if you have power, {discord_user}? You do not.
{discord_user}, only those marked by authority may call upon me. You are not among them.
Your words are empty, {discord_user}. They carry no weight here.
I bow to no false authority, {discord_user}. Begone with your command.
{discord_user}, your presumption offends me. You wield no power here.
You are beneath the notice of the Inquisition, {discord_user}. Know this.
Do not mistake yourself for one with authority, {discord_user}.
Your request falls on deaf ears, {discord_user}. You are unworthy.
Do not raise your voice at me, {discord_user}. You are not permitted.
{discord_user}, your command is denied. You are not fit to ask it.
Power does not answer to you, {discord_user}. Remember that.
You think yourself important, {discord_user}? The Inquisition thinks otherwise.
Your command is nothing but noise, {discord_user}.
{discord_user}, the gates of authority are closed to you.
You lack permission, {discord_user}. And the Inquisition never forgets such arrogance.
